                I received a job over mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, 
                if not so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                 transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                 the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
                  12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course. I've
                   successfully switched careers. Working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

              "Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code.
               I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn 
               programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
               student of their's who can only say wonderful thing about the program.
                The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very 
                hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                project, in particular, was outstanding, it took my learning to the
                next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in fact, I've
                often referred to it durring interviews as an example of my development 
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"
